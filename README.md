# Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for my master's thesis on machine learning for network intrusion detection at Ghent University. The goal of this thesis is to develop a methodology that detects contaminating features in intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques such as SHAP. Additionally, the inter-dataset generalization technique is employed to assess the impact of these features on the generalization ability of machine learning (ML) models.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **contaminant_discovery:** Contains the code for the training and analysis phase of our methodology to detect contaminants.
- **contaminant_validation_phase:** Includes the code for the validation phase of the methodology.
- **generalization:** Contains bash scripts and Python scripts to run the inter-dataset generalization testing.
- **generalization_heatmap:** Stores the heatmaps generated by running the inter-dataset generalization testing code.
- **ks-test:** Contains the code for the KS-test and the analysis of the KS-test results.
- **plots:**
  - **boxplots:** Contains boxplots for comparing feature distribution.
  - **ks_test_scatter:** Includes scatterplots of the results of the KS-test code.
  - **ks_test_violin:** Contains violin plots of the results of the KS-test code.

## Getting Started
The following packages are needed to run the code in this repository:
- numpy
- pandas
- fastai
- seaborn
- sklearn
- scipy
- shap
- matplotlib
- plotly.express
